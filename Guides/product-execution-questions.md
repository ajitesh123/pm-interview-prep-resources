# Product Execution Questions - PM Interview Guide

## Overview
Product execution questions assess your ability to make decisions and solve problems using data, metrics, and sound product judgment. They simulate the day-to-day analytical and operational skills needed for the PM job.

## What They Test
- Analytical problem-solving abilities
- Data-driven decision making
- Critical thinking and business intuition
- Communication of complex issues
- Ability to handle ambiguity and make trade-offs

## Three Main Types

### 1. Problem Diagnosis Questions
Present an unexpected outcome and ask you to find the root cause.

**Examples:**
- "Daily active users dropped 30% last week, investigate why"
- "App crashes increased suddenly, how would you diagnose?"
- "Conversion rate fell 20%, what happened?"

### 2. Trade-off Evaluation Questions
Present competing options with different benefits and drawbacks.

**Examples:**
- "Feature A improves engagement but reduces revenue, what do you do?"
- "Your largest customer wants a custom feature outside the roadmap"
- "Should Instagram show stories for 24hr or 48hr?"

### 3. Behavioral/Hypothetical Questions
Test how you handle common PM situations.

**Examples:**
- "How do you resolve conflicting product requirements?"
- "A top customer escalates to leadership for a feature, how do you respond?"
- "Your team missed a critical deadline, what do you do?"

## Process of Elimination Approach

### For Problem Diagnosis

**Step 1: Clarify the Problem**
- Timeframe of the issue
- Scope and scale of impact
- Recent changes or events
- Definition of metrics

**Step 2: Apply Process of Elimination**
Break into mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive components:

**Option A - Technical Stack:**
- Client-side issues
- Network problems
- Server-side failures

**Option B - Customer Journey:**
- Discovery/acquisition
- Onboarding
- Core feature usage
- Retention

**Step 3: Systematic Investigation**
- Don't jump between categories randomly
- Fully explore each component
- Mark components for revisiting if needed
- Avoid "guessing around"

**Step 4: Make Recommendations**
- Identify most likely root cause
- Propose immediate actions
- Suggest preventive measures
- Define success metrics

### Sample Problem Diagnosis Answer

**Question**: "Reddit traffic is down 5%, investigate why"

**Answer Structure**:
1. **Clarify**:
   - How is traffic measured? (unique visits)
   - Sudden or gradual? (continuous over last week)
   - Geographic/platform scope? (global, all platforms)

2. **Investigate by category**:
   - **Technical**: No crashes, latency issues, or correlation with updates
   - **Product changes**: New UI features launched but impact seems limited
   - **Market forces**: 
     - Check acquisition channels → Web traffic down significantly
     - Drill into web sources → Google search referrals dropped
     - Root cause: Reddit protest made subreddits private, affecting Google indexing

3. **Recommendations**:
   - Short-term: Communicate with community
   - Long-term: Diversify traffic sources
   - Monitor: Set up alerts for traffic composition changes

## Goal-Oriented Decision Making

### For Trade-off Questions

**Step 1: Establish Goals**
- Clarify company priorities
- Understand success metrics
- Align on timeframe

**Step 2: Define Evaluation Criteria**
Based on goals, typically include:
- User impact
- Business impact
- Technical feasibility
- Risk level
- Time to market

**Step 3: Analyze Options**
- List pros and cons
- Quantify impacts where possible
- Consider second-order effects
- Identify dependencies

**Step 4: Make Recommendation**
- State your decision clearly
- Acknowledge trade-offs
- Propose risk mitigation
- Define success tracking

### Sample Trade-off Answer

**Question**: "Netflix considering ad-supported tier, help make the decision"

**Answer Structure**:
1. **Goal**: Maximize long-term revenue in mature market

2. **Key factors**:
   - **Competitive dynamics**: Avoid price war as market leader
   - **New acquisition**: Untapped price-sensitive segment exists
   - **Cannibalization risk**: Some premium users might downgrade
   - **Execution risk**: No ads experience, brand impact

3. **Recommendation**: Launch ad tier because:
   - Captures new segment without price war
   - Competitors proved model works
   - Can minimize cannibalization with restrictions
   - Partner with Microsoft for ads expertise

4. **Risk mitigation**:
   - Limit content on ad tier
   - Geographic pilot first
   - Monitor brand sentiment

## Key Skills for Success

### 1. Structured Thinking
- Use frameworks but adapt to situation
- Be MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)
- Show clear logic flow
- Avoid jumping to conclusions

### 2. Data Orientation
- Ask for relevant data
- Make reasonable assumptions
- Use benchmarks and analogies
- Quantify impacts

### 3. Business Judgment
- Consider multiple stakeholders
- Think about long-term effects
- Balance user and business needs
- Show market awareness

### 4. Communication
- Think out loud
- Summarize findings clearly
- Use visual aids if helpful
- Check for understanding

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### In Problem Diagnosis:
- Jumping to solutions before finding root cause
- Not being systematic in investigation
- Ignoring data or timeline clues
- Forgetting to verify assumptions

### In Trade-off Decisions:
- Not clarifying goals upfront
- Ignoring second-order effects
- Being too rigid in thinking
- Forgetting implementation risks

### General:
- Analysis paralysis
- Not making a clear recommendation
- Ignoring stakeholder perspectives
- Forgetting about user impact

## Navigating Team Decisions

### Three Approaches:
1. **Escalation**: Last resort for deadlocked critical decisions
2. **Collaborative Framework**: Most common at big tech
3. **Domain Expert Decision**: For specialized areas

### Effective Collaboration Process:
1. Agree on shared goals
2. Define evaluation criteria
3. Gather data and evidence
4. Make decision with clear rationale
5. Plan for "disagree and commit"

### Watch for Biases:
- **Sunk cost fallacy**: Continuing because of past investment
- **Confirmation bias**: Seeking supporting data only
- **Anchoring bias**: Over-relying on first information
- **Framing bias**: Being swayed by presentation

## Real-World Practice

### Build Skills Through:
- Participating in incident analysis
- Leading cross-functional decisions
- Analyzing A/B test results
- Writing post-mortems
- Reviewing competitor moves

### Key Phrases to Use:
- "Let me break this down systematically..."
- "The data suggests..."
- "Considering the trade-offs..."
- "From the user's perspective..."
- "The business impact would be..."

## Quick Decision Framework

**For any execution question:**
1. **Clarify**: Understand the full context
2. **Structure**: Break down the problem
3. **Analyze**: Use data and logic
4. **Decide**: Make clear recommendation
5. **Plan**: Define next steps

Remember: Execution questions test your ability to handle real PM situations. Show structured thinking, data orientation, and clear communication. The process matters as much as the answer.
