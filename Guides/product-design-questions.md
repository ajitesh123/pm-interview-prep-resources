# Product Design Questions - PM Interview Guide

## Overview
Product design questions lie at the heart of PM interviews and test your ability to define what to build. These questions assess how you would collaborate with cross-functional teams to create Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) and solve customer problems.

## What They Test
- Ability to identify and solve specific customer problems
- Product thinking and creativity
- Prioritization skills with limited resources
- Understanding of user needs and pain points
- Consideration of privacy, security, and technical constraints

## Common Question Formats

### 1. Improvement of Existing Products
- "What's your favorite product? How would you improve it?"
- "Redesign Uber for visually challenged users"
- "As PM for Facebook during COVID, what features would you add?"

### 2. New Product Design
- "Google invented teleportation technology, design a product"
- "Design a self-driving car for kids"
- "Create a lending product for Facebook"
- "Design an app to buy wine"

## Three-Step Approach

### Step 1: Goals and Constraints
- **Identify goals**: Market penetration, user engagement, monetization
- **Set constraints**: Timeline (1 year vs 10 years), resources, technology
- **Define success metrics**: Using HEART framework (Happiness, Engagement, Adoption, Retention, Task success)

### Step 2: Customer Problem
- **Go broad, then narrow**: List 3 customer segments, then pick one
- **Deep dive on chosen segment**: Create detailed persona
- **Identify pain points**: Use customer journey mapping
- **Frame the problem**: Create a clear "How might we..." statement

### Step 3: Solutions
- **Brainstorm broadly**: Generate 3 diverse solutions
- **Vary complexity**: Simple → Medium → Futuristic/10X
- **Prioritize**: Choose MVP based on impact and feasibility
- **Show creativity**: Mix software, hardware, and service solutions

## Brainstorming Techniques for 10X Ideas

### 1. Anchor to Emerging Technologies
- AR/VR: Overlay digital information, immersive experiences
- GenAI: Text/image/video generation, personalization
- Blockchain: Decentralized systems, smart contracts
- IoT: Connected devices, ambient computing
- Quantum computing: Complex problem solving

### 2. Use Analogies and Biomimicry
- Draw inspiration from other industries
- Learn from nature's solutions (lotus effect → self-cleaning surfaces)
- Apply successful patterns from different contexts

### 3. SCAMPER Method
- **S**ubstitute: Replace components with alternatives
- **C**ombine: Merge with other products/features
- **A**dapt: Modify for new uses
- **M**odify/Magnify: Enhance or minimize aspects
- **P**ut to other uses: Find new applications
- **E**liminate: Remove unnecessary elements
- **R**everse/Rearrange: Flip the approach

### 4. Sci-Fi and Fiction Inspiration
- Harry Potter magic → real-world applications
- Star Trek technologies → future products
- Black Mirror scenarios → ethical considerations

## Sample Answer Structure

**Question**: "Design a fitness app for a Big Tech company"

**Answer**:
1. **Clarify Goals**: Mass adoption first, monetize later, 2-3 year horizon
2. **Customer Segments**: 
   - Bodybuilders (niche)
   - Weight-loss seekers (massive market) ✓
   - Runners/cyclists (passionate but small)
3. **Deep Dive**: 35-year-old working parent, time-starved, confused by conflicting advice
4. **Problem Statement**: "How might we help busy professionals lose weight efficiently?"
5. **Solutions**:
   - Simple: AI chatbot with human trainer oversight
   - Medium: AR home gym with haptic feedback
   - Complex: Transforming furniture (desk→gym equipment)

## Key Tips for Success

### Do's:
- **Be specific**: Avoid vague customer segments like "millennials"
- **Show empathy**: Truly understand user pain points
- **Think creatively**: Include at least one 10X idea
- **Consider edge cases**: Accessibility, privacy, global usage
- **Prioritize clearly**: Explain your rationale

### Don'ts:
- **Don't rush**: Take time to understand the problem
- **Don't be generic**: Avoid overused ideas
- **Don't ignore constraints**: Work within stated limitations
- **Don't forget MVP**: Always define what to build first
- **Don't propose existing features**: Research the product beforehand

## Favorite Product Question Tips
- Choose a niche product you're passionate about
- Know it inside-out (more than the interviewer)
- Have 3-4 backup options ready
- Structure: Brief intro → 3 reasons why → Wait for follow-up
