# Case Study: How would you improve the LinkedIn mobile app?

## Question Type: Product Design

## Framework Applied: Goals & Constraints → Customer Problem → Solutions

---

### Step 1: Goals and Constraints (3-4 minutes)

**Clarifying Questions:**
- What's the primary goal - engagement, new user growth, or monetization?
- Are we focusing on the main LinkedIn app or considering companion apps?
- Any specific user segments showing low engagement on mobile?
- Should we consider emerging markets with different connectivity?
- Are there features exclusive to desktop we want to bring to mobile?

**Assumed Context:**
- Goal: Increase daily active usage and engagement on mobile (currently lagging desktop)
- Scope: Main LinkedIn app, global focus
- Timeline: 12-month roadmap
- Constraint: Must maintain professional tone/brand
- Current state: Mobile used mainly for passive browsing, not active networking

**Key Insight:** LinkedIn mobile is treated as a "lite" version of desktop, missing opportunities for unique mobile-first professional experiences.
