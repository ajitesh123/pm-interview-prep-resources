# Question 2: Amazon Prime Pricing Analysis

## Question
"The VP wants to lower Amazon Prime from $79.99 to $69.99 per year. Should we do it?"

### Step 1: Clarify Strategic Context

**Key Questions:**
- What's driving this proposal? → *Growth has slowed, seeking new members*
- Current member satisfaction? → *High (85% renewal rate)*
- Competitive pressure? → *Walmart+ launching at $98/year*

### Step 2: Why - Analyze Market Forces

**Customer Analysis:**
- Current members: 20M highly satisfied
- Price-sensitive prospects: 10-15M potential
- Elasticity estimate: -1.2 (12.5% price drop → 15% volume gain)

**Competition Analysis:**
- Costco: $60/year (different model)
- Walmart+: Planning $98/year
- No direct comparable service

**Company Analysis:**
- Current profit per member: $300/year (shopping behavior)
- Shipping costs: $360/year per member
- Breakeven through shopping margin

**Market Trends:**
- Subscription fatigue emerging
- Price consciousness increasing
- Expectation of bundle value rising

### Step 3: What - Define Strategic Options

**Strategic Question**: How do we grow Prime membership while maintaining profitability?

**Success Criteria:**
1. Net profit impact (must be positive within 2 years)
2. Member growth (target 30M members)
3. Competitive positioning maintained

### Step 4: How - Generate and Evaluate Options

#### Option Generation

**Option A: Lower to $69.99 (as proposed)**
- Simple price cut across the board
- 12.5% reduction

**Option B: Maintain $79.99 with Enhanced Value**
- Add more benefits instead of cutting price
- Invest in content, faster delivery

**Option C: Segmented Pricing**
- Students: $39
- Seniors: $59  
- Regular: $79.99
- Family: $119

**Option D: New Entry Tier**
- Prime Lite: $49 (limited benefits)
- Prime Classic: $79.99
- Prime Plus: $119 (additional benefits)

#### Financial Analysis Framework

For each option, calculate:
1. Member growth projection
2. Revenue impact
3. Cost impact (shipping, content)
4. 3-year NPV

#### Detailed Analysis: Option A ($69.99)

**Year 1 Impact:**
```
Membership Revenue:
- Old: 20M × $80 = $1,600M
- New: 23M × $70 = $1,610M
- Delta: +$10M

Shopping Profit:
- Existing: 20M × $300 = $6,000M
- New members: 3M × $200 = $600M
- Total: $6,600M

Costs:
- Shipping increase: 3M × 40 orders × $8 = $960M
- Content costs: $150M
- Net Impact: -$1,100M

Year 1 Result: -$1,090M
```

**3-Year Projection:**
- Break-even requires 40% member growth
- Unlikely given elasticity estimates
- Creates dangerous precedent

#### Evaluation Matrix

| Option | Profit Impact | Growth | Risk | Feasibility | Score |
|--------|--------------|--------|------|-------------|-------|
| A: Cut Price | Very Negative | Medium | High | Easy | 2/10 |
| B: Add Value | Neutral | Low | Low | Medium | 6/10 |
| C: Segments | Positive | High | Medium | Hard | 8/10 |
| D: Tiers | Positive | High | Low | Medium | 9/10 |

### Step 5: Strategic Recommendation

**Recommendation: Option D - Tiered Pricing Strategy**

**Why Not Lower Price:**
1. Massive Year 1 loss (-$1.1B)
2. Difficult to raise prices later
3. Better alternatives available

**Recommended Approach:**
1. **Prime Lite ($49)**
   - Free shipping (5-day)
   - Limited video content
   - Target price-sensitive segment

2. **Prime Classic ($79.99)**
   - Current benefits maintained
   - Protect base revenue

3. **Prime Plus ($119)**
   - Same-day delivery
   - Full content library
