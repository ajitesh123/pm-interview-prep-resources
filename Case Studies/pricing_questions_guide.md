## Pricing Strategy Framework

### The PRICE Method™

**P** - Position in market (premium/value/penetration)
**R** - Reference pricing (competitors, substitutes)
**I** - Internal economics (costs, margins, goals)
**C** - Customer willingness to pay
**E** - Elasticity and segmentation

### Key Pricing Concepts

1. **Value-Based Pricing**: Price based on customer perceived value
2. **Cost-Plus Pricing**: Cost + desired margin
3. **Competitive Pricing**: Based on competitor prices
4. **Dynamic Pricing**: Varies by time, demand, segment
5. **Freemium/Tiered**: Multiple price points for different needs

# Question 2: Amazon Prime Pricing Analysis

## Question
"The VP wants to lower Amazon Prime from $79.99 to $69.99 per year. Develop financial projections for this decision."

### Step 1: Current State Analysis

**Prime Program Overview:**
- Current Price: $79.99/year
- Estimated Members: 20M (at time of case)
- Current Revenue: $1.6B/year

**Member Benefits:**
- Free 2-day shipping (all orders)
- Prime Video streaming
- Prime Music (limited)
- Kindle Lending Library
- Early access to deals

### Step 2: Understand Price Change Impact

**Direct Revenue Impact:**
```
Current: 20M members × $79.99 = $1,599.8M
New: 20M members × $69.99 = $1,399.8M
Revenue Loss: -$200M/year (12.5% decrease)
```

**But this is just the beginning...**

### Step 3: Elasticity Analysis

**Price Elasticity Estimation:**

Based on similar subscription services:
- Netflix: -0.8 elasticity
- Costco: -0.6 elasticity
- Amazon Prime (estimated): -1.2 elasticity

**Why Higher Elasticity?**
- Lower price point (vs Costco)
- More substitutes available
- Value prop varies by user

**New Member Calculation:**
```
% Price Change: -12.5%
Elasticity: -1.2
% Quantity Change: 12.5% × 1.2 = 15%
New Members: 20M × 1.15 = 23M
```

### Step 4: Comprehensive Financial Model

#### A. Membership Revenue
```
New Membership Revenue: 23M × $69.99 = $1,609.8M
Previous Revenue: $1,599.8M
Net Gain: +$10M
```

#### B. Incremental Shopping Behavior

**Current Prime Member Behavior:**
- Annual Spend: $1,200
- Orders per Year: 60
- Gross Margin: 25%
- Profit per Member: $300

**New Member Profile (Price-Sensitive):**
- Annual Spend: $800 (33% less)
- Orders per Year: 40
- Same Gross Margin: 25%
- Profit per Member: $200

**Shopping Profit Impact:**
```
Existing Members: 20M × $300 = $6.0B
New Members: 3M × $200 = $0.6B
Total Shopping Profit: $6.6B
```

#### C. Shipping Cost Analysis

**Current State:**
- Average Shipping Cost: $8/order
- Prime Orders: 20M × 60 = 1.2B orders
- Total Shipping: $9.6B
- Non-Prime Revenue: $2.4B (they pay)
- Net Shipping Cost: $7.2B

**New State:**
- Existing Orders: 1.2B × $8 = $9.6B
- New Member Orders: 3M × 40 × $8 = $960M
- Total Shipping: $10.56B
- Non-Prime Revenue: $2.0B (less non-Prime)
- Net Shipping Cost: $8.56B
- **Increase: $1.36B**

#### D. Content & Services Impact

**Video Streaming:**
- Cost per Member: $50/year
- New Members: 3M
- Additional Cost: $150M

**Music & Other Services:**
- Cost per Member: $10/year
- Additional Cost: $30M

**Total Content Cost:** $180M

#### E. Lifetime Value Consideration

**Churn Analysis:**
- Current Price Churn: 15%/year
- Lower Price Churn: 12%/year (estimated)
- Retention Improvement: 3%

**LTV Calculation:**
```
Current LTV: $300 / 0.15 = $2,000
New LTV: $200 / 0.12 = $1,667
Blended LTV: (20M × $2,000 + 3M × $1,667) / 23M = $1,957
```

### Step 5: Competitive Response

**Walmart+ Implications:**
- Currently $98/year
- Might lower to $59 to undercut
- Could trigger price war

**Target/Best Buy:**
- May launch competing services
- Further fragmenting market

### Step 6: Strategic Considerations

**Positive Factors:**
1. **Market Expansion**: Reaches price-sensitive segment
2. **Network Effects**: More Prime = better for sellers
3. **Data Value**: 3M new customers' shopping data
4. **Ecosystem Lock-in**: Harder to leave at lower price

**Risk Factors:**
1. **Brand Perception**: May seem less premium
2. **Anchor Pricing**: Hard to raise later
3. **Margin Pressure**: Less room for benefits expansion
4. **Competitive Response**: Price war risk

### Financial Summary

#### Year 1 Projection
```
Revenue Changes:
+ Membership Revenue: +$10M
+ Shopping Profit (new): +$600M
- Shipping Costs: -$1,360M
- Content Costs: -$180M
Net Impact: -$930M
```

#### Year 3 Projection (with growth)
```
Members: 30M (30% growth)
Revenue Changes:
+ Membership Revenue: +$500M
+ Shopping Profit: +$2.1B
- Shipping Costs: -$2.2B
- Content Costs: -$300M
Net Impact: +$100M
```

### Recommendation: NO - Don't Lower Price

**Key Reasons:**

1. **Massive Year 1 Loss**: -$930M impact
2. **Break-even Requires**: 50% member growth
3. **Irreversible Decision**: Can't raise price easily
4. **Better Alternatives Available**:
   - Student Prime at $39
   - Monthly option at $12.99
   - Prime Day promotions
   - Targeted discounts

**Alternative Recommendation:**

Instead of lowering price:
1. **Segment-Specific Pricing**:
   - Students: $39
   - Seniors: $59
   - Low-Income: $5.99/month

2. **Enhance Value**:
   - Add more content
   - Expand same-day delivery
   - Include more services

3. **Payment Options**:
   - Monthly: $7.99
   - Quarterly: $24.99
   - Annual: $79.99

### Model Sensitivity Analysis

**Key Assumptions to Monitor:**
- Elasticity (-1.2): If only -0.8, lose $1.2B
- New member spend ($800): If only $600, lose $1.1B
- Churn improvement (3%): If only 1%, lose $200M

**Break-Even Scenarios:**
- Need 40% member growth (28M total)
- OR new members spend $1,000/year
- OR reduce shipping cost to $6/order
- OR achieve 6% churn rate

### Interview Answer Template

"I'll analyze the proposed Prime price reduction from $80 to $70 annually by modeling revenue, cost, and strategic impacts.

**Direct Impact:**
Current revenue: 20M × $80 = $1.6B
New revenue: 20M × $70 = $1.4B
Loss: $200M

**Member Growth:**
With -1.2 price elasticity and 12.5% price cut, we'd gain 15% more members (3M), bringing total to 23M.

**Full Financial Impact:**

*Revenue gains:*
- Membership: +$10M (net of price cut)
- Shopping profit: +$600M (3M × $200 margin)

*Cost increases:*
- Shipping: -$1.36B (3M × 40 orders × $8)
- Content: -$180M

**Year 1 Net Impact: -$930M loss**

**Recommendation: Don't lower price**

The math doesn't work unless we achieve 40%+ member growth. Instead, I'd recommend targeted discounts (students, seniors) and enhanced value to justify current pricing.

The $930M Year 1 loss is too steep, and raising prices later would be nearly impossible. Better to maintain price integrity and grow through segmentation."
