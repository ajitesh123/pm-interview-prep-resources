# Case Study: Google shut down Google Latitude. How would you redesign and re-launch a location-sharing app?

## Question Type: Product Design

## Framework Applied: Goals & Constraints → Customer Problem → Solutions

---

### Step 1: Goals and Constraints (3-4 minutes)

**Clarifying Questions:**
- Why did Google Latitude fail initially? What were the main issues?
- What's our goal with the relaunch - safety, social, or something else?
- Are we building standalone app or integrating with existing Google services?
- What's our approach to privacy concerns that killed the original?
- Any specific markets or demographics to target first?

**Assumed Context (based on question):**
- Original failure: Privacy concerns ("jealous spouse" reputation), poor adoption
- Goal: Create valuable location sharing that people actually want to use
- Timeline: 12-month development cycle
- Constraint: Must address privacy as core feature, not afterthought
- Opportunity: Leverage advances in AI, wearables, and changed social norms

**Key Insight:** Location sharing failed because it was a solution looking for a problem. We need to start with real user needs where location adds unique value.

### Step 2: Customer Problem Analysis (8-10 minutes)

#### Customer Segments (Go Broad)

1. **Parents & Family Safety**
   - Size: 500M+ parents globally
   - Needs: Child safety, elderly care, peace of mind
   - Pain: Current solutions are creepy or require expensive devices

2. **Event & Activity Coordinators**
   - Size: 2B+ people attending events
   - Needs: Coordinate meetups, find friends in crowds, share experiences
   - Pain: Texting "where are you?" constantly, missing connections

3. **Safety-Conscious Individuals**
   - Size: 1B+ runners, hikers, travelers
   - Needs: Safety backup, emergency response, journey tracking
   - Pain: No automated safety net, manual check-ins burden others

**Selected Segment: Parents & Family Safety** (clearest value prop, willing to pay, less privacy sensitive for family)

#### Problems for Parents & Families (Go Narrow)

1. **The Safety Paradox**
   - Want kids to be independent but need peace of mind
   - Current tracking feels like surveillance
   - No graduated privacy as kids grow
   - Emergency situations need instant location

2. **Coordination Chaos**
   - School pickup confusion
   - Family members at different activities
   - Last-minute schedule changes
   - No context beyond dot on map

3. **Elder Care Anxiety**
   - Aging parents want independence
   - Memory issues create safety risks
   - Current solutions are stigmatizing
   - Need subtle safety nets

**Selected Problem: The Safety Paradox** (unique emotional challenge, opportunity for innovative privacy model)

**Problem Statement:** "How might we help families stay connected and safe through location sharing that enhances trust rather than eroding it?"

### Step 3: Solutions (12-15 minutes)

#### Solution Brainstorming

**Solution 1: Circle of Trust - Graduated Privacy System (Simple)**
- **What:** Family location sharing with age-appropriate privacy levels
- **Features:**
  - "Safety Zones" - notify only when leaving designated areas
  - "Check-in Moments" - kids share location at key times, not constantly
  - "Trust Score" - earn more privacy with responsible behavior
  - Emergency button overrides all privacy settings
  - Location history only for emergencies
- **Why it works:** Balances independence with safety, grows with the child
- **MVP:** Basic zones + emergency button for 5 family members

**Solution 2: Context-Aware Family Compass (Medium Complexity)**
- **What:** AI-powered location sharing that understands context and intent
- **Features:**
  - Shows what matters: "At school" not "123 Main St"
  - Predictive ETA: "Mom will arrive in 10 min based on traffic"
  - Smart notifications: Only alerts for unusual patterns
  - "Journey Stories" - auto-generated family timelines
  - Integration with Calendar for automatic context
  - "Virtual Carpooling" - coordinate with other parents
  - Mood indicators - optional sharing of how you're feeling
- **Why it works:** Provides useful context, not just surveillance
- **Implementation:** Leverage Google Maps, Calendar, and AI

**Solution 3: Guardian Angel Network (Futuristic/10X)**
- **What:** Invisible safety net that activates only when needed
- **Features:**
  - Biometric monitoring through wearables/phones
  - AI detects distress (fall, unusual vitals, deviation from routine)
  - Graduated response: Check-in → Family alert → Emergency services
  - "Time Travel" - reconstruct someone's day only in emergencies
  - Mesh network with other users for crowd safety
  - Predictive safety: "Take Main St, construction on usual route"
  - Integration with smart home, car, city infrastructure
  - Holographic family presence for elderly comfort
- **Why it works:** Maximum safety with minimum intrusion
- **Requirements:** Advanced AI, wearable adoption, city partnerships

#### Prioritization & MVP Recommendation

**Recommended Starting Point: Context-Aware Family Compass**

**Rationale:**
- Solves real problem (coordination) not just enabling surveillance
- Differentiates through context, not just location
- Natural integration with Google ecosystem
- Positive use cases combat privacy stigma
- Scalable to other segments later

**MVP Features (6 months):**
1. Family circles (up to 6 members)
2. Semantic locations ("At school" not coordinates)
3. Smart notifications for unusual activity
4. Calendar integration for context
5. Emergency button with immediate sharing

**Phase 2 (9 months):**
- Predictive ETA with traffic
- Journey Stories feature
- Virtual Carpooling
- Wearable integration

**Phase 3 (12 months):**
- AI pattern learning
- Mesh safety network
- City infrastructure integration
- Enterprise/school partnerships

### Privacy & Trust Design

**Core Principles:**
1. **Consent First:** Everyone opts in, including kids
2. **Minimal Viable Sharing:** Only share what's needed
3. **Transparent Controls:** Clear UI for all privacy settings
4. **Data Minimization:** Auto-delete after purpose served
5. **No Ads Ever:** Subscription model only

**Trust Features:**
- "Privacy Report Card" - weekly summary of who saw what
- "Ghost Mode" - scheduled privacy for teens
- Data portability and deletion rights
- End-to-end encryption for location data
- Regular privacy audits and transparency reports

### Differentiation from Original Latitude

1. **Purpose-Driven:** Solves family coordination, not general tracking
2. **Context > Coordinates:** Semantic understanding of location
3. **Privacy by Design:** Not bolted on after complaints
4. **Positive Framing:** Safety and connection, not surveillance
5. **Ecosystem Play:** Integrated with Calendar, Maps, Assistant

---

### Risks & Mitigation

**Privacy Backlash:**
- Lead with privacy features in marketing
- Get privacy advocates on advisory board
- Regular third-party audits

**Abuse Potential:**
- Mandatory consent education
- Abuse detection algorithms
- Partnership with domestic violence orgs

**Technical Challenges:**
- Battery optimization crucial
- Gradual rollout for scale
- Fallback to cell towers if GPS fails

**Competition:**
- Apple FindMy integration → Focus on Android+iOS families
- Life360 dominance → Better privacy and context features
- WhatsApp location → Deeper integration and intelligence
