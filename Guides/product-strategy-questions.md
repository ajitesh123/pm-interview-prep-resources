# Product Strategy Questions - PM Interview Guide

## Overview
Product strategy questions test your ability to think strategically about product direction and communicate it effectively. These questions are more common at big tech firms where there are many choices and product areas to focus on.

## What They Test
- Analysis of market forces (customer preferences, competition, technological trends)
- Ability to create a persuasive, concise product narrative
- Balanced level of details to supplement high-level strategy
- Strategic thinking and vision setting capabilities

## Common Question Formats

### 1. General Strategy
- "You're the PM for X, what should be the 3-year strategy?"
- "Developing strategy for addressing a business challenge"

### 2. Market Entry
- "Should company X enter market Y?"
- "Should Amazon scale back its hardware product investments?"

### 3. Identifying New Market Opportunities
- Open-ended questions about new industries or product areas a company could consider

## The "Why, What, How" Approach

### Step 1: Get clarity on scope and context
Ask clarifying questions about:
- Geographic scope (global vs regional)
- Time horizon (3-year vs 5-year)
- Strategic goals (growth, monetization, market share)

### Step 2: Analyze market forces (The "Why")
Analyze relevant factors:
- **Customer segments**: Size, growth, underserved needs
- **Competition**: Key bets, growth path, intensity
- **Company**: Strengths and weaknesses
- **Trends**: AI, AR/VR, localization, emerging technologies

### Step 3: Define product vision and pillars (The "What")
- Create a 1-2 line compelling product vision
- Define 3 strategic pillars (keep it to 3 as a rule)
- Ensure pillars address the insights from your analysis

### Step 4: Propose concrete features (The "How")
- Offer solutions in increasing order of complexity
- Focus on 1-2 strategic pillars
- Don't propose existing features as "new"

## Sample Answer Structure

**Question**: "You're the PM of Google Maps, what should be its 3-year strategy?"

**Answer outline**:
1. **Clarify**: Global scope, focus on market share + monetization
2. **Analyze**: 
   - Underserved senior citizens segment
   - Competition from Apple Maps in premium segment
   - Untapped monetization potential
   - Emerging tech: AR/VR, GenAI
3. **Vision**: Maintain market leadership while unlocking monetization through underserved segments and new technologies
4. **Pillars**:
   - Increase adoption in senior citizen segment

   - Improve monetization through business features

## Key Tips
- **Think big**: Include some 10X/moonshot ideas, especially for longer time horizons
- **Stay strategic**: Focus on business strategy, not feature lists
- **Be coherent**: Ensure features align with strategic pillars
- **Take pauses**: Use time to structure thoughts between sections
