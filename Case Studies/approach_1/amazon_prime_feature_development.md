# Amazon Prime Feature Development

## Question Type: Product Design

**Question:** Assume you are the new product manager in our Amazon Prime business and are in charge of feature development. What data would you look at to develop new features? What new features would they be?

## Solution Framework

### Goals and Constraints

**Goal:** Increase the number of new Prime customers
- 65% of Amazon customers are aware of Prime, but only half have paid for it
- Primary reason: they don't find the value proposition compelling
- Current Prime adoption: 5-30% of Amazon's ~30 million customers

**Constraints:**
- Focus on product features (not marketing solutions)
- Must address customer pain points with Amazon shopping experience
- Features should be cost-effective and scalable

### Key Insights from Analysis

1. **Customer-Centric Approach:** Focus on solving real customer pain points rather than just adding features
2. **Data-Driven Decisions:** Use behavioral data to identify the most impactful problems to solve
3. **Incremental Value:** Build features that provide clear, measurable value over existing Prime benefits
4. **Cost-Benefit Analysis:** Balance feature impact with operational costs and complexity
