# Case Study: You are the product manager for Google+. What killer feature would you build?

## Question Type: Product Design

## Framework Applied: Goals & Constraints → Customer Problem → Solutions

---

### Step 1: Goals and Constraints (3-4 minutes)

**Clarifying Questions:**
- What's the primary goal - user acquisition, engagement, or differentiation from Facebook?
- What's our timeline and resource constraints?
- Are we open to pivoting Google+'s positioning entirely?
- What's our risk appetite for bold/experimental features?
- Any specific user segments we're prioritizing?

**Assumed Context:**
- Goal: Drive 30% user engagement increase in 3 months (aggressive growth)
- Constraint: Must leverage Google's unique assets/capabilities
- Timeline: Ship MVP in 6 months
- Risk appetite: High - need breakthrough innovation
- Current state: Google+ has infrastructure but lacks compelling use case

**Key Insight:** Google+ can't win by copying Facebook. We need a fundamentally different value proposition that only Google can deliver.

### Step 2: Customer Problem Analysis (8-10 minutes)

#### Customer Segments (Go Broad)

1. **Knowledge Workers & Professionals**
   - Size: 500M+ globally
   - Needs: Professional networking, knowledge sharing, thought leadership
   - Pain: LinkedIn too formal, Facebook too personal, Twitter too noisy

2. **Content Creators & Educators**
   - Size: 50M+ creators globally
   - Needs: Audience building, monetization, deeper engagement
   - Pain: Platform algorithms limit reach, shallow interactions

3. **Niche Communities & Hobbyists**
   - Size: 2B+ people with specific interests
   - Needs: Deep discussions, expertise sharing, finding tribe
   - Pain: Facebook groups too general, Reddit too anonymous

**Selected Segment: Knowledge Workers & Professionals** (aligns with Google's strengths, differentiated from Facebook's social focus)

#### Problems for Knowledge Workers (Go Narrow)

1. **Knowledge Fragmentation**
   - Insights scattered across email, docs, social posts
   - No way to build on collective intelligence
   - Valuable discussions lost in feed algorithms

2. **Shallow Professional Networking**
   - LinkedIn = resumes, Facebook = personal life
   - No platform for substantive professional discourse
   - Missing middle ground for "professional but human"

3. **Limited Learning Amplification**
   - Read articles but can't discuss with smart people
   - No way to connect learning to practical application
   - Expertise isn't recognized or rewarded

**Selected Problem: Knowledge Fragmentation** (unique opportunity leveraging Google's data/AI capabilities)

**Problem Statement:** "How might we help knowledge workers capture, connect, and build upon collective intelligence from their professional interactions?"

### Step 3: Solutions (12-15 minutes)

#### Solution Brainstorming

**Solution 1: Smart Circles - AI-Curated Knowledge Groups (Simple)**
- **What:** Dynamic interest-based circles that adapt based on your Google activity
- **Features:**
  - Auto-generates circles from Gmail, Calendar, Search, Docs activity
  - "Work Project Circle" - includes all collaborators, relevant docs, discussions
  - "Learning Circle" - people searching/reading similar topics
  - AI summarizes key insights from circle discussions
- **Why it works:** Leverages Google's data advantage, reduces manual curation
- **MVP:** Start with work email integration, 5 smart circles per user

**Solution 2: Knowledge Graph Social Network (Medium Complexity)**
- **What:** Transform social connections into a living knowledge graph
- **Features:**
  - Every post/comment creates knowledge nodes and connections
  - Visual map of expertise across your network
  - "Knowledge Paths" - see how ideas evolved through discussions
  - AI-powered "Insight Synthesis" - weekly digest of network's best ideas
  - Expertise scoring based on engagement quality, not likes
  - Integration with Google Scholar, Patents, Books
- **Why it works:** Creates unique value from professional discussions
- **Implementation:** Build on Google's Knowledge Graph infrastructure

**Solution 3: Collective Intelligence Platform (Futuristic/10X)**
- **What:** Google+ becomes humanity's collaborative brain
- **Features:**
  - Real-time thought streaming with neural interface (future)
  - AI moderates and connects related thoughts across millions
  - "Eureka Moments" - AI identifies breakthrough insight combinations
  - Global problem-solving rooms with automatic translation
  - Reputation system based on idea impact, not popularity
  - "Time Capsule Discussions" - revisit how thinking evolved
  - Integration with all Google services for context
  - Holographic meeting spaces for deep collaboration
- **Why it works:** Transforms social from entertainment to intelligence amplification
- **Requirements:** Advanced AI, neural interfaces (long-term), massive compute

#### Prioritization & MVP Recommendation

**Recommended Starting Point: Knowledge Graph Social Network**

**Rationale:**
- Uniquely leverages Google's strengths (Knowledge Graph, AI, Search)
- Clear differentiation from Facebook's social focus
- Appeals to Google's core user base (professionals, researchers)
- Natural integration points with other Google services
- Scalable foundation for future innovation

**MVP Features (3 months):**
1. Basic knowledge graph visualization of your discussions
2. AI-powered weekly insight synthesis
3. Integration with Google Workspace (Docs, Gmail)
4. Expertise indicators based on discussion quality

**Phase 2 (6 months):**
- Full knowledge path tracking
- Cross-language insight connections
- Integration with Scholar/Patents
- Advanced expertise scoring

**Phase 3 (12 months):**
- Global problem-solving rooms
- Real-time collaboration features
- API for enterprise integration
- Monetization through premium insights

### Success Metrics

**Primary Metrics:**
- Weekly active knowledge workers (target: 10M in 6 months)
- Insight interactions per user (target: 20+ per week)
- Knowledge graph connections created (target: 1B+ in year 1)

**Quality Metrics:**
- Average expertise score growth (+15% quarterly)
- Valuable insight identification rate (>80% accuracy)
- Cross-pollination rate (ideas spreading across domains)

**Business Metrics:**

### Risks & Mitigation

**Adoption Risk:**
- "Another social network" perception → Position as "intelligence network"
- Requires behavior change → Start with existing Google users

**Technical Risk:**
- AI accuracy for insight synthesis → Human-in-the-loop validation initially
- Scale challenges → Gradual rollout, use Google infrastructure

**Competitive Risk:**
- LinkedIn could copy → Move fast, deep Google integration
- Facebook could pivot → Focus on professional use case they can't serve

**Business Model Risk:**
- Monetization unclear → Enterprise subscriptions, API access, premium insights
