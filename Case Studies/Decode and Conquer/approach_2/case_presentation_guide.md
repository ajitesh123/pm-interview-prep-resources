## Presentation Delivery Guide

### Opening (2 minutes)
"Imagine you want to sell your old couch. Today, you'd post on Craigslist and hope the anonymous buyer isn't scary. What if instead, you could see they're a friend of your colleague Sarah, have 50 five-star reviews, and Facebook would help ensure you meet safely? That's Marketplace."

### Structure Your Talk
1. **Problem** (5 min): Market opportunity and user pain
2. **Solution** (10 min): Product walkthrough with mockups
3. **Business** (10 min): GTM, metrics, revenue
4. **Risks** (3 min): Honest assessment
5. **Q&A** (remaining): Interactive discussion

### Anticipated Q&A

**Q: "How is this different from existing Facebook buy/sell groups?"**

A: "Great question. Groups are unstructured - just photo posts with comments. Marketplace adds:
- Structured listings with search/filter
- Dedicated discovery experience  
- Transaction safety features
- Cross-group inventory

We'll actually partner with groups, letting them import listings."

**Q: "What if Craigslist sues for anti-competition?"**

A: "We've consulted legal. Classifieds is an open market with many players. We're not blocking Craigslist access or using anti-competitive practices. Our advantages (identity, social graph) are from our core platform, not marketplace-specific barriers."

**Q: "Why would sellers switch from established platforms?"**

A: "Three reasons:
1. **Reach**: 200M US Facebook users vs 60M on Craigslist
2. **Trust**: Real identities reduce no-shows by 70%
3. **Convenience**: Already on Facebook daily

Our research shows 67% of Craigslist users would switch for identity verification alone."

**Q: "How do you prevent Facebook from becoming a garage sale?"**

A: "Quality control through:
- ML-powered listing standards (photos, descriptions)
- Price guidance to prevent overpricing
- Category restrictions (no MLMs, adult content)
- Community reporting with fast response

We want to be the nicest neighborhood garage sale, not a flea market."
