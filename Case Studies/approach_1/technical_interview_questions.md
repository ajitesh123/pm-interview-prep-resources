- **View Relationships:** 
  - Stalker: A views B, B doesn't view A
  - Acquaintances: A views B, B views A
- **Follow States:** Following, being followed, mutual following

#### Algorithm Categories

**1. Network-Based Algorithms**
- **Mutual connections:** Recommend users with many mutual followers
- **Friend-of-friend:** If A follows B and B follows C, recommend C to A
- **Clustering:** Group users with similar following patterns

**2. Content-Based Algorithms**
- **Topic similarity:** Analyze tweet content and recommend users with similar interests
- **Hashtag overlap:** Users who use similar hashtags
- **Engagement patterns:** Users who like/retweet similar content

**3. Collaborative Filtering**
- **User-based:** Find users with similar following patterns
- **Item-based:** Recommend accounts similar to ones user already follows
- **Matrix factorization:** Use latent factors to predict preferences

**4. Graph-Based Algorithms**

## Question 2: Explain Recursion

**Question:** Explain recursion to someone without a technical background.

### Solution Framework

**Definition:** Recursion is a method where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.

#### Movie Theater Analogy
"Imagine you're in a movie theater where rows aren't numbered. Someone asks you which row you're in. You don't want to count, so you ask the person in front of you. They don't want to count either, so they ask the person in front of them.

This continues until reaching the front row. That person sees no one ahead, so they say 'I'm in row 1.' The person in row 2 adds 1 and tells the person behind 'You're in row 3.'

This continues back to you with your answer."

#### Key Components
1. **Base case:** The front row (stopping condition)
2. **Recursive case:** Ask the person in front + 1
3. **Problem reduction:** Each person solves a smaller version of the same problem

#### Code Example
```c
unsigned int factorial(unsigned int n) {
    if (n == 0) {        // Base case
        return 1;
    } else {
        return n * factorial(n - 1);  // Recursive case
    }
}
```

#### Real-World Applications
- **File systems:** Searching through folder hierarchies
- **Organization charts:** Finding reporting structures

## Question 3: Object-Oriented Programming

**Question:** Explain object-oriented programming to your grandmother.

### Solution Framework

**Core Concept:** OOP organizes code into objects rather than just a sequence of tasks.

#### Racing Game Example

**Basic Car Object:**
- **State (Properties):** Current speed, brake status, steering direction
- **Operations (Methods):** Accelerate, brake, steer

**Inheritance Example:**
- Start with basic "car" object
- Create "BMW" based on car object (inherits accelerate, brake, steer)
- Add BMW-specific features: automatic windshield wipers

#### Key Benefits

**1. Time Savings**
- Don't recreate identical functionality
- Reuse existing code through inheritance

**2. Easy Understanding**
- Object metaphor mirrors real world
- Clear communication about capabilities

**3. Organization**
- Keep related functionality together
- Prevent inappropriate actions (Toyota Prius can't remove convertible top)

#### Real-World Analogy
Think of objects like appliances:
- **Microwave object:** Has timer, power level (state) and heat, defrost, stop (operations)
- **Smart microwave:** Inherits basic functionality, adds WiFi connectivity
- **Industrial microwave:** Different power levels but same basic operations

#### Technical Benefits
- **Encapsulation:** Hide internal complexity
- **Inheritance:** Build on existing functionality
- **Polymorphism:** Same operation, different implementations

## Question 7: Meeting Conflict Detection Algorithm

**Question:** Write an algorithm that detects meeting conflicts.

### Solution Framework

**Problem:** Determine if two meetings overlap in time

#### Algorithm Logic

**Meeting Representation:**
- S1, E1: Start and end time of first meeting
- S2, E2: Start and end time of second meeting

**Conflict Conditions:**
Meetings conflict if:
- Second meeting starts before first meeting ends: S2 < E1
- Second meeting ends after first meeting starts: E2 > S1

**Combined Logic:**
```c
bool IsConflict(DateTime s1, DateTime e1, DateTime s2, DateTime e2) {
    return (s2 < e1) && (e2 > s1);
}
```

#### Extended Implementation

**Multiple Meeting Conflicts:**
```c
bool HasConflicts(Meeting[] meetings) {
    for (int i = 0; i < meetings.length; i++) {
        for (int j = i + 1; j < meetings.length; j++) {
            if (IsConflict(meetings[i].start, meetings[i].end, 
                          meetings[j].start, meetings[j].end)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

**Optimization:** Sort meetings by start time, then check only adjacent meetings for better performance O(n log n) vs O(n²).

#### Edge Cases
- Same start/end times (consider as conflict or not based on requirements)
- Zero-duration meetings
- All-day events
- Different time zones
