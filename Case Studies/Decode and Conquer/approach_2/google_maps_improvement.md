# Case Study: How would you improve Google Maps?

## Question Type: Product Design

## Framework Applied: Goals & Constraints → Customer Problem → Solutions

---

### Step 1: Goals and Constraints (3-4 minutes)

**Clarifying Questions:**
- What's the primary goal for this improvement? (User engagement, monetization, market expansion?)
- What's our timeline - quick wins in 6 months or transformative changes in 2-3 years?
- Are we focusing on global improvements or specific regions?
- Any technical constraints we should consider?
- Are we considering all platforms (mobile, web, auto) or focusing on one?

**Assumed Context:**
- Goal: Increase user engagement and expand use cases beyond navigation
- Timeline: 18-month horizon allowing for meaningful innovation
- Scope: Global improvements, all platforms
- Success Metrics: Daily active users, session duration, feature adoption rate

---

### Step 2: Customer Problem Analysis (8-10 minutes)

#### Customer Segments (Go Broad)

1. **Urban Explorers & Tourists**
   - Size: 500M+ users globally
   - Needs: Discover interesting places, cultural context, real-time events
   - Current pain: Limited discovery features, static information

2. **Daily Commuters**
   - Size: 2B+ users globally  
   - Needs: Predictable routes, real-time traffic, multimodal transport
   - Current pain: Limited proactive suggestions, single-mode focus

3. **Local Business Seekers**
   - Size: 1B+ users globally
   - Needs: Find services, compare options, make decisions quickly
   - Current pain: Limited business insights, outdated information

**Selected Segment: Urban Explorers & Tourists** (largest growth potential, aligns with engagement goals)

#### Problems for Urban Explorers (Go Narrow)

1. **Discovery is Limited to Search**
   - Users must know what they're looking for
   - Miss spontaneous experiences and hidden gems
   - No serendipitous discovery based on real-time context

2. **Lack of Immersive Context**
   - 2D maps don't capture atmosphere or vibe
   - Missing historical/cultural information
   - Can't preview experiences before visiting

3. **Social Isolation**
   - No way to see where friends are exploring
   - Can't share live experiences or get recommendations
   - Missing community-driven insights

**Selected Problem: Lack of Immersive Context** (biggest differentiation opportunity)

**Problem Statement:** "How might we help urban explorers experience places more immersively before and during their visits to make better decisions and have richer experiences?"

### Step 3: Solutions (12-15 minutes)

#### Solution Brainstorming

**Solution 1: AR Time Machine (Simple)**
- **What:** Point phone at any location to see historical overlays
- **Features:**
  - View how buildings/streets looked in different eras
  - See historical events that occurred at that spot
  - Compare past vs present through AR slider
- **Why it works:** Adds cultural depth, educational value, unique to Google's data
- **MVP:** Start with 10 major tourist cities, partner with museums

**Solution 2: Immersive Street View 2.0 (Medium Complexity)**
- **What:** Enhanced Street View with real-time elements and sensory information
- **Features:**
  - Live webcam integration showing current crowds/weather
  - Audio snippets - hear the ambiance of locations
  - Time-lapse view showing location at different times/seasons
  - User-generated 360° content with timestamps
  - "Vibe indicators" - busy, quiet, touristy, local favorite
- **Why it works:** Helps users preview experiences, reduces decision anxiety
- **Implementation:** Leverage existing Street View infrastructure + crowdsourcing

**Solution 3: Neural Maps - AI Experience Curator (Futuristic/10X)**
- **What:** AI that learns your preferences and creates personalized, immersive journey maps
- **Features:**
  - Generates custom "experience paths" based on mood, interests, time
  - Real-time AR navigation with contextual information bubbles
  - Predictive suggestions: "People like you loved this hidden cafe"
  - Social layer: See live heatmaps of where similar users are exploring
  - "Teleportation preview" - VR preview of any location before going
  - Emotion mapping - routes optimized for desired feelings (adventurous, relaxed, inspired)
- **Why it works:** Transforms maps from utility to experience platform
- **Requirements:** Advanced AI/ML, AR glasses integration, massive compute

#### Prioritization & MVP Recommendation

**Recommended Starting Point: Immersive Street View 2.0**

**Rationale:**
- Builds on existing Google assets (Street View infrastructure)
- Technically feasible with current technology
- Clear user value proposition
- Natural progression path to more advanced features

**MVP Features (6 months):**
1. Time-lapse Street View for top 100 tourist destinations
2. Crowd-sourced "vibe indicators" and real-time busyness
3. Audio snippets for immersive preview
4. Integration with existing reviews/photos

**Phase 2 (12 months):**
- Expand to 1000 cities
- Add AR navigation overlay
- Introduce social features (see where friends explored)

**Phase 3 (18 months):**
- Launch Neural Maps AI recommendations
- VR preview capabilities
- Full AR Time Machine feature

### Success Metrics

**Primary Metrics:**
- Feature adoption rate (target: 30% of urban explorers within 6 months)
- Session duration increase (target: +25%)
- Discovery-led navigation starts (target: 40% increase)

**Secondary Metrics:**
- User-generated content uploads (+100%)
- Social shares from Maps (+50%)
- Business profile views from immersive features (+35%)

**Guardrail Metrics:**
- Core navigation accuracy maintained
- App performance (load time <2s)
- Privacy concerns/complaints (<0.1%)

### Key Differentiators

1. **Only Google Can Do This:**
   - Leverages unique Street View infrastructure
   - Combines search, maps, and AI capabilities
   - Massive existing user base for network effects

2. **Creates New User Behavior:**
   - Transforms maps from "getting there" to "experiencing places"
   - Enables virtual tourism and preview experiences
   - Makes exploration social and shareable

3. **Platform for Future:**
   - Ready for AR glasses adoption
   - Foundation for metaverse-style experiences
   - New monetization opportunities (virtual tours, business showcases)

### Risks & Mitigation

**Technical Risks:**
- AR accuracy in diverse environments → Start with controlled tourist areas
- Data storage/bandwidth requirements → Progressive loading, edge computing

**User Risks:**
- Privacy concerns with social features → Opt-in only, clear controls
- Information overload → Smart filtering, personalization

**Business Risks:**
- Cannibalization of simple navigation → Position as complementary experience layer
- Competitive response → Move fast, leverage unique Google assets
