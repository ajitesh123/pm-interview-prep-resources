# Question 1: Metrics to Evaluate Product Success

## General Framework

### Step 1: Clarify Context (30 seconds)
- Product type and stage
- Business model
- Key stakeholders
- Time horizon

### Step 2: Define Success
- Business objectives
- User value proposition
- Strategic goals

### Step 3: Build Metrics Hierarchy

```
North Star Metric
    ├── Driver Metrics
    │   ├── Leading Indicators
    │   └── Health Metrics
    └── Guardrail Metrics
        ├── Quality Metrics
        └── Ecosystem Health
```

## Example: LinkedIn Testing Profile Photo in Signup

### Context Understanding
**Current State**: Photo upload after signup
**Test**: Move photo upload into signup flow
**Hypothesis**: Earlier photo → more engagement

### Metrics Framework

#### 1. Primary Success Metrics

**Signup Funnel**
```
Start Signup → Complete Basic Info → Upload Photo → Finish
    ↓              ↓                    ↓            ↓
   100%           85%                  60%          50%

Key Metrics:
- Signup Completion Rate (Primary)
- Drop-off at Each Step
- Time to Complete
- Error Rates
```

**Activation Metrics**
- % completing profile within 7 days
- % adding 5+ connections in first week
- % returning within 48 hours

#### 2. Engagement Metrics (Post-Signup)

**Profile Quality**
```
Quality Score = (
    Has Photo × 0.3 +
    Has Headline × 0.2 +
    Has Summary × 0.2 +
    Has Experience × 0.3
)
```

**Activity Metrics**
- Posts created per user
- Comments/reactions per user
- Profile views received
- InMails sent

#### 3. Network Effects

**Connection Metrics**
- Invitations sent per user
- Acceptance rate
- Time to 10 connections
- Connection velocity

**Viral Coefficient**
```
K = (Invites Sent × Acceptance Rate × Signup Rate)
If K > 1, viral growth
```

#### 4. Long-term Retention

**Cohort Analysis**
```
Week    W1    W2    W4    W8    W12
Cohort A 100%  45%   30%   25%   20%
Cohort B 100%  55%   40%   35%   30%
(B = with photo in signup)
```

**Resurrection Rate**
- % dormant users who return
- Triggered by photo visibility

### Statistical Rigor

**Sample Size Calculation**
```python
def calculate_sample_size(baseline_rate, min_effect, power=0.8, alpha=0.05):
    # For 50% baseline, 5% lift, need ~15,000 per variant
    return 2 * (baseline_rate * (1-baseline_rate)) * \
           ((z_alpha + z_power) / min_effect) ** 2
```

**P-Value Interpretation**
- p < 0.05: Statistically significant
- Consider practical significance too
- Watch for multiple testing issues

### Decision Framework

**Go/No-Go Criteria**
1. Signup completion > -5% (guardrail)
2. 7-day activation > +3% (success)
3. Profile quality > +10% (success)
4. No degradation in spam reports

**Trade-off Analysis**
```
Benefit: +10% activation, +15% profile quality
Cost: -8% signup completion
Net Value: Positive if LTV gain > CAC increase
```

     ↓              ↓              ↓           ↓
  More Value   Shared Outside   New Users   Network Effect
```

**Measurement**:
- Spaces discovered through sharing
- Join rate from external links
- Member-to-member invites
- Cross-pollination between spaces

#### 5. Platform Impact

Week 2 Spaces: 72% → 53% → 43% → 38%
Improvement shows product-market fit
```

#### Predictive Metrics
```python
def predict_space_success(space_data):
    features = [
        'members_in_first_24h',
        'messages_in_first_week',
        'file_uploads',
        'member_diversity_score',
        'creator_history'
    ]
    return ml_model.predict_survival(features)
```

### Experimentation Framework

**A/B Tests Queue**:

## Meta-Framework: Choosing the Right Metrics

### 1. Align with Strategy
```
Business Goal → User Value → Key Behavior → Metric

Example:
Revenue → Job Success → Apply to Jobs → Application Rate
```

### 2. Leading vs Lagging
- **Leading**: Predictive of future success
- **Lagging**: Confirms past success
- Prefer leading indicators for faster iteration

### 3. Actionable Metrics
Good metrics are:
- **Comparative**: A vs B clear
- **Understandable**: Team gets it
- **Ratio/Rate**: Not just counts
- **Changeable**: You can impact it

### 4. Avoid Vanity Metrics
- Total registered users (vs active)
- Page views (vs engagement)
- Downloads (vs usage)
- Gross revenue (vs margin)

### 5. Counter-Metrics
Always pair with guardrails:
- Growth ↔ Quality
- Engagement ↔ Spam
- Revenue ↔ Churn
- Speed ↔ Accuracy

## Interview Success Formula
