# Case Study: Design a new iPad app for Google Spreadsheet

## Question Type: Product Design

## Framework Applied: Goals & Constraints → Customer Problem → Solutions

---

### Step 1: Goals and Constraints (3-4 minutes)

**Clarifying Questions:**
- Is this a new standalone app or replacing the current Google Sheets iPad app?
- What's the primary goal - adoption, engagement, or differentiation from Excel?
- Are we targeting specific use cases (personal, business, education)?
- Should this integrate with other Google Workspace apps?
- Any technical constraints with iPad hardware we should leverage/consider?

**Assumed Context:**
- Goal: Create a best-in-class iPad spreadsheet experience to drive adoption
- Target: Both business and personal users, emphasis on unique iPad capabilities
- Timeline: 12-month development cycle
- Constraint: Must maintain compatibility with web/desktop versions
- Opportunity: iPad's touch, Apple Pencil, and powerful processor

**Key Insight:** Current spreadsheet apps treat iPad as a "small laptop" rather than leveraging its unique capabilities. We can reimagine spreadsheets for touch-first, visual interaction.

### Step 2: Customer Problem Analysis (8-10 minutes)

#### Customer Segments (Go Broad)

1. **Mobile Business Professionals**
   - Size: 200M+ iPad business users
   - Needs: Quick edits, presenting data, field work
   - Pain: Complex formulas hard on touch, poor visualization

2. **Data Analysts & Researchers**
   - Size: 50M+ analysts using tablets
   - Needs: Data exploration, quick insights, collaboration
   - Pain: Limited power features, can't match desktop workflow

3. **Personal Finance & Small Business**
   - Size: 500M+ managing budgets/inventory
   - Needs: Simple tracking, visual insights, templates
   - Pain: Overwhelming features, steep learning curve

**Selected Segment: Mobile Business Professionals** (largest segment with clear iPad use cases, high value)

#### Problems for Mobile Professionals (Go Narrow)

1. **Touch Input Nightmare**
   - Selecting cells precisely is frustrating
   - Formula entry on keyboard is error-prone
   - Copy/paste workflows are clunky
   - No natural gestures for common tasks

2. **Context Switching Penalty**
   - Constantly switching between sheets/apps
   - Can't see source data while building
   - Lose context when referencing other docs
   - Collaboration requires leaving spreadsheet

3. **Presentation Paralysis**
   - Static sheets don't tell stories
   - Building charts is desktop-centric
   - No interactive data exploration
   - Screen sharing loses fidelity

**Selected Problem: Touch Input Nightmare** (most acute iPad-specific pain, biggest differentiation opportunity)

**Problem Statement:** "How might we make spreadsheet manipulation feel as natural as paper while leveraging iPad's unique touch and pencil capabilities?"

### Step 3: Solutions (12-15 minutes)

#### Solution Brainstorming

**Solution 1: Gesture-Based Spreadsheet (Simple)**
- **What:** Natural gestures replace menu navigation
- **Features:**
  - Pinch to create pivot tables
  - Swipe to autofill patterns
  - Draw to select custom ranges
  - Two-finger tap for format painter
  - Force touch for cell options
  - Shake to undo
- **Why it works:** Intuitive, fast, reduces UI clutter
- **MVP:** 10 core gestures for most common actions

**Solution 2: Spatial Canvas Spreadsheet (Medium Complexity)**
- **What:** Spreadsheets become infinite canvases with smart layers
- **Features:**
  - Zoom out to see entire data landscape
  - Multiple sheets visible simultaneously
  - Drag formulas between sheets visually
  - Apple Pencil annotations that stick to cells
  - "Data Lenses" - overlay different views
  - Picture-in-picture for reference data
  - Split view with live formula preview
  - Handwriting recognition for formulas
- **Why it works:** Matches how people think about data relationships
- **Implementation:** iPad's powerful GPU for smooth zooming/panning

**Solution 3: AI-Powered Living Spreadsheets (Futuristic/10X)**
- **What:** Spreadsheets that understand intent and adapt dynamically
- **Features:**
  - Voice commands: "Show me sales trends"
  - Auto-generates appropriate visualizations
  - Predictive data entry using patterns
  - Real-time collaboration with presence
  - AR mode - project sheets on surfaces
  - AI suggests formulas based on data
  - Gesture recording for macro creation
  - Natural language formulas
  - Data stories - auto-narrative generation
  - Integration with camera for receipt/data scanning
- **Why it works:** Eliminates technical barriers, focuses on insights
- **Requirements:** Advanced on-device ML, ARKit integration

#### Prioritization & MVP Recommendation

**Recommended Starting Point: Spatial Canvas Spreadsheet**

**Rationale:**
- Uniquely leverages iPad's screen and touch capabilities

**MVP Features (6 months):**
1. Infinite canvas with smooth zoom/pan
2. Multi-sheet simultaneous view
3. Apple Pencil support for selection/annotation
4. Basic gesture set (pinch, swipe, drag)
5. Visual formula building with drag-and-drop

**Phase 2 (9 months):**
- Advanced Data Lenses
- Handwriting recognition
- Picture-in-picture reference
- Collaborative presence

**Phase 3 (12 months):**
- AI formula suggestions
- Voice commands
- AR projection mode
- Natural language formulas
